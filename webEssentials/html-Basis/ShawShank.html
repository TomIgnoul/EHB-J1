    <h1>Featured Review</h1>
    <h2>Stephen King's best adapted movie</h2>
    I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw
    <b>The Shawshank Redemption</b>. Shawshank encompasses friendships,
    hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that
    it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the
    characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far
    removed from what the characters are going through. King is one of the best
    writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of
    the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by
    the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and
    of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner.
    Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King
    film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that
    beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message
    it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins,
    has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses
    hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of
    tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind
    and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has
    never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.
